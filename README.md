This is a custom HACS-compatible integration for the Marstek Venus E home battery system, using **Modbus TCP** via an **RS485-to-WiFi gateway**. No YAML required. The integration provides sensors, switches and number controls to monitor and manage the battery directly from Home Assistant.

### üß© Requirements

- A configured **Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP bridge** connected to the battery's RS485 port
- The IP address and port of the Modbus TCP (usually port 502)
- Home Assistant Core 2025.9 or later
- HACS installed

### üîß Features

- Native Modbus TCP polling via `pymodbus`
- Polling is now handled centrally via the DataUpdateCoordinator with dynamic polling intervals
- Dynamic polling intervals per entity type
- Dependency entities are always polled, even if the related entity is disabled
- Fully asynchronous operation for optimal performance and responsiveness
- Sensors for voltage, current, SOC, power, energy, and fault/alarm status (combined bits)
- Switches for force charge/discharge control
- Adjustable charge/discharge power (0‚Äì2500W)
- Entities grouped under a device in Home Assistant
- Select entity support for multi-state control (e.g., force mode)
- Select entity for control modes (e.g., force mode, grid standard)
- Backup mode control and charge/discharge to SOC included
- Includes calculated sensors: round-trip efficiency (total/monthly) and stored energy
- Reset button to allow manual reset of the battery management system via Home Assistant
- Some advanced sensors are disabled by default to keep the UI clean
- UI-based configuration (Config Flow)
- Fully local, no cloud required

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=marstek_modbus)  
5. Enter the IP and port of your EW11 gateway (default: port 502)



## ‚úÖ Tested Devices for Modbus TCP

The Marstek Venus Modbus integration has been tested with the following hardware:
- Elfin EW11 WiFi to RS485 Converter
- PUSR DR134 Modbus Gateway
- Waveshare RS485 to RJ45 Ethernet Converter
- M5Stack RS485 + Atom S3 Lite
For more details and updates, see GitHub issue [#25](https://github.com/ViperRNMC/marstek_venus_modbus/issues/25).



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Bugs

- **User Work Mode (AI Optimized) not reflected correctly**  
  Setting `User Work Mode` to `2 (Trade Mode)` in Home Assistant may not correctly show the updated state.  
  The Marstek app shows the correct mode, but Home Assistant may continue to display the previous state due to a discrepancy in the Modbus register response.  
  This is a known issue with the current Modbus firmware and integration handling.
